# UnScrabbler  
This class reads in a file of words, which is stored in an arraylist. This program will then take in
a string of length n and finds words of length n-1 found in the arraylist containing the words. Ex. String n is state. words of length five in state that is found in the text file is state, a word of length 4 is tate. this program does that all the way down to length n-1.
